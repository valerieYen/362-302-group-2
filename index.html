        <p id="introduction">
        Our project will focus on creating an app that will serve as a hub for events and activities available to UMD students. The app will update students on all campus events, including sports games, pop-up shops, crimes that occur on or near campus, rallies, student club meetings, and much more. While all this information is currently available to students, it is scattered across several platforms making it difficult to keep track of everything. Our app would provide all that information in one place, making it very easy for students to be informed about events on campus. We would also allow students and other users of the apps to provide updates to ensure that all events are accounted for and to create a source of information driven by the UMD community. Overall, our goal is to provide a source of easy information to enhance student engagement and participation in campus events and to improve campus safety by giving a central hub for all important events and updates.

        <article>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p id="problem">
            The University of Maryland's student population struggles with identifying events on campus in a timely manner. Being that a lot of these events are pop-up, it is difficult for students who want to remain active in their community to stay up to date. For this, we’ve conceptualized an app similar to YikYak in which students could post in a forum of currently occurring events. We acknowledge that YikYak does divide into subsections such as school and there is overlap within that and TestuKnow, however UMD’s YikYak is also cluttered with random posts from students and a centralized platform like this would be beneficial to the student population.
          </p>

          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a website that UMD students can use to find information and social events</li>
            <li>Make the website easily accessible</li>
            <li>Allow students to update the website so that any and all campus events are included</li>

            The team conducted user interviews to gather information about how UMD students discover and attend events. These interviews were framed as part of a user-centered design class project. Participants were informed that their responses would remain confidential and only be used for class purposes. With permission, the team took notes and, where possible, recorded responses.
