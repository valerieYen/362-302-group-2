        <p id="introduction">
          Our project focuses on creating an app that serves as a hub for events and activities available to UMD students. The app will update students on campus events, including sports games, pop-up shops, crimes that occur on or near campus, rallies, student club meetings, and more. While all this information is currently available to students, it is scattered across several platforms, making it difficult to keep track of everything. Our app will provide that information in one place, making it easier for students to stay informed about events on campus. We will also allow students and other users of the app to provide updates to ensure that all events are accounted for and to create a source of information driven by the UMD community. Overall, our goal is to provide an easy source of information that enhances student engagement and participation in campus events and improves campus safety by giving a central hub for all important events and updates.

        <article>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p id="problem">
            The University of Maryland's student population struggles to identify events on campus in a timely manner. Because many of these events are pop-up or advertised late, it is difficult for students who want to remain active in their community to stay up to date. For this, we have conceptualized an app similar to YikYak in which students can post in a forum of currently occurring events. While YikYak has school-based subsections that overlap with TestuKnow, UMD’s YikYak is cluttered with off-topic posts from students. A centralized, event-focused platform like TestuKnow would be more beneficial to the student population.
          </p>

          <h3>High-Level Project Goals</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a website that UMD students can use to find information about social and campus events.</li>
            <li>Make the website easily accessible and straightforward to navigate.</li>
            <li>Allow students to update the website so that any and all campus events are included.</li>

        <p>
          Our research combined multiple methods to understand how UMD students currently discover campus events, what barriers they face, and how a centralized event platform could better support them. We used:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Semi-structured interviews</strong> to explore students’ event-finding habits, tools, and pain points.</li>
          <li><strong>Contextual observations</strong> using an AEIOU framework to see how students interact with event-discovery tools in real settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Survey-based sentiment scores</strong> to compare perceived busyness with attitudes toward existing platforms like TerpLink and YikYak, visualized with D3 scatterplots.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This mix of qualitative and quantitative methods allowed us to identify not only what tools students use, but why certain platforms feel cluttered, confusing, or unreliable. Together, these insights informed the core concept and feature set of TestuKnow.

          <h3>Interview Methodology</h3>
          <p>
            We conducted user interviews with UMD students as part of a user-centered design process. Participants were informed that the study was for a class project, that their responses would remain confidential, and that they could decline to answer any question. With permission, we took notes and, when possible, recorded responses to capture detailed quotes and behaviors.

          The affinity map below organizes key insights from five user interviews into thematic clusters. Each sticky note represents an individual comment or observation, grouped by ideas such as motivation to attend events, platform usability, awareness channels, and desired app features. This helped us identify patterns like low intentional search for events, heavy reliance on social media and peers, and frustration with existing tools’ usability and targeting.

          We use the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to define our primary goal for TestuKnow:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>SMART Goal:</strong> By the end of the Spring 2025 semester, we will launch a TestuKnow web platform that allows UMD students to find and post information about campus events (including club meetings, games, pop-up events, and other activities). Within the first week after launch, at least 20 unique events will be posted by students or organizations.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Specific:</strong> A web platform where UMD students can both discover and post campus events.</li>
          <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> At least 20 unique events posted within the first week after launch.</li>
          <li><strong>Achievable:</strong> Feasible given our team size, existing prototype, and available course timeline.</li>
          <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Directly supports our goal of improving event visibility, community engagement, and campus safety.</li>
          <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Launch and measurement window tied to the end of Spring 2025 and the first week post-launch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="prototype-heading">Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          Based on our research insights, we developed a clickable mid-fidelity prototype of TestuKnow. The prototype is organized around several key pages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Match Page:</strong> Shows recommended events tailored to user interests.</li>
          <li><strong>Lineup Page:</strong> Lets users view their saved events in both list and calendar formats.</li>
          <li><strong>Profile Page:</strong> Shows basic user information and preference settings that influence recommendations.</li>
          <li><strong>Settings Page:</strong> Allows users to adjust notification and privacy options.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These pages work together to support a typical student journey: discovering events, deciding what to attend, and tracking an upcoming event schedule. The layout, navigation labels, and card-based event presentation are informed by our interviews and early sentiment analysis findings.

        <h2 id="usability-plan-heading">Usability Testing Plan</h2>
        <p>
          We designed a moderated, task-based usability test to evaluate the clarity, navigation, and overall usability of the TestuKnow prototype. Our objectives were to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assess how easily students can discover events using the Match page.</li>
          <li>Evaluate whether students can successfully RSVP to events and manage their personal lineup.</li>
          <li>Identify any confusion or friction when accessing the Profile and Settings pages.</li>
          <li>Capture qualitative feedback on overall flow, information clarity, and feature relevance.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="./images/students_testing.jpg" alt="Usability testing session with UMD students " class="norm-image" />

        <h3>Participants</h3>
        <p>
          We tested the prototype with 15–18 UMD undergraduate students who reflect our target user base. Participants varied in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Frequency of attending campus events (rarely to weekly).</li>
          <li>Tools currently used to find events (Instagram, GroupMe, SEE pages, email newsletters, TerpLink).</li>
          <li>Methods of schedule tracking (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Notes, Notion, or no formal system).</li>
          <li>Overall campus involvement (from introverted students to highly engaged club members).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core Tasks</h3>
        <p>Each participant was asked to complete the following core tasks within the prototype:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Navigate to the <strong>Match Page</strong> where recommended events appear.</li>
          <li>RSVP to one event and deny another event from the match list.</li>
          <li>Navigate to the <strong>Lineup Page</strong> and view both the list view and the calendar view.</li>
          <li>Navigate to the <strong>Profile Page</strong> and review personal data and preferences.</li>
          <li>Navigate to the <strong>Settings Page</strong> and explore notification and privacy options.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Methods and Metrics</h3>
        <p>
          We used a think-aloud protocol and moderated the sessions in small groups of two to three students. We captured:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Task success and click paths for each core task.</li>
          <li>Perceived difficulty ratings (Likert scale 1–5) for each task.</li>
          <li>Qualitative comments about what felt intuitive or confusing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A scoring instrument was used to record ease-of-use ratings, navigation scores, and the number of clicks required. This allowed us to compare results across participants systematically.

        <h2 id="usability-results-heading">Usability Testing Analysis &amp; Results</h2>

        <h3>Quantitative Findings</h3>
        <p>
          Participants rated seven key tasks on a 1–5 scale (1 = very difficult, 5 = very easy). Overall, all tasks scored above the midpoint, with average ratings around 3.7–4.5:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Core flows such as viewing the Match page, RSVPing, denying events, and accessing the Profile page were rated as some of the easiest tasks (around 4.5).</li>
          <li>The Lineup and Calendar views received slightly lower ratings, in the high 3s, indicating that browsing and planning interactions felt less straightforward.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We also ran a non-parametric test (Friedman) to compare ratings across tasks. The differences were statistically significant, suggesting that some parts of the interface are consistently easier than others. Correlation analysis between task ratings showed that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tasks in the core “match and decision” flow were strongly positively correlated, implying a cohesive interaction pattern.</li>
          <li>Lineup and Calendar tasks were moderately correlated with other flows, suggesting they felt somewhat distinct and are potential areas for improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Qualitative Findings</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to numeric ratings, we collected rich qualitative feedback through pre-task questions, post-task debriefs, and think-aloud comments. Common themes included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many students rely heavily on Instagram and group chats for event discovery and will return to those tools if a new app feels slower or more confusing.</li>
          <li>Participants appreciated the relevance of recommended events on the Match page but wanted more control over filtering (time of day, location, event type, food availability, etc.).</li>
          <li>Multiple participants reported that the Calendar was “hard to find” or “didn’t stand out,” and that the Lineup page felt somewhat disconnected from the main flows.</li>
          <li>Students emphasized the importance of quick, glanceable information. Several mentioned that if they could not find what they needed within a few seconds, they would likely leave.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We organized these insights into an affinity map to cluster recurring issues and opportunities.

        <p>
          Our entire team collaborated to run and analyze the usability testing sessions, with clearly defined roles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Facilitator (Valerie Yen):</strong> Led the testing script, guided participants through tasks, and maintained a consistent think-aloud protocol.</li>
          <li><strong>Prototype Navigator &amp; Tech Support (Aditya Hardikar):</strong> Ensured the prototype loaded correctly, reset state between participants, and handled any technical issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Primary Note-Taker (Zola Chanyalew):</strong> Recorded participant quotes, confusion points, task completion details, and Likert ratings.</li>
          <li><strong>Secondary Note-Taker (Aditya Patel):</strong> Captured additional behavioral observations and helped ensure that no key comments were missed.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Analysis &amp; Scoring (Sean Case):</strong> Compiled all test results, standardized language across entries, and identified recurring trends to inform the next iteration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Having clear roles helped each session run smoothly, reduced overlap, and ensured that data collection and analysis were systematic and reliable.

      <section id="final-outcomes" aria-labelledby="final-outcomes-heading">
        <h2 id="final-outcomes-heading">Final Outcomes &amp; Learning Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Through this project, we moved from a broad frustration—students missing out on campus events—to a concrete concept and tested prototype for TestuKnow. Our early research highlighted scattered information sources, overreliance on social media, and the difficulty of distinguishing genuine event information from noise. The prototype and usability testing gave us evidence that a more focused, event-first platform can feel intuitive and valuable to students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantitatively, we learned that core flows such as viewing the Match page, RSVPing, and reviewing profile information already work well for most participants. Qualitatively, we saw that students appreciate speed, visual clarity, and minimal friction when evaluating events. We also discovered that certain pages (especially Calendar and Lineup) need stronger visual hierarchy, clearer signposting, and tighter integration with the Match flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a team, we gained experience with the full UX research and design cycle: problem framing, mixed-method research, ideation, prototyping, and evidence-based iteration. We also learned how important it is to test early and often, especially when building tools that must integrate smoothly into students’ busy, multi-device routines.

      <section id="future-direction" aria-labelledby="future-direction-heading">
        <h2 id="future-direction-heading">Future Direction: What’s Next for TestuKnow?</h2>
        <p id="up-next-blurb">
          After our survey and initial usability testing phases, we plan to refine the Proof of Concept for TestuKnow to specifically address pain points identified with YikYak, TerpLink, and our own early design. In the near term, we will:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Redesign the Lineup and Calendar views to be easier to find and more visually consistent with the Match page.</li>
          <li>Introduce more granular filters (time, location, event type, availability of food/free items) to better match students’ preferences.</li>
          <li>Streamline navigation so core actions require fewer clicks and less cognitive effort.</li>
          <li>Continue improving our recommendation logic so that suggested events feel increasingly relevant over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once these changes are implemented, we plan to invite previous participants to test the updated version and compare results against our current findings. By iterating on both the interface and underlying logic, our long-term goal is to roll out TestuKnow to a broader segment of the UMD community and evaluate its impact on event awareness, attendance, and students’ sense of connection to campus life.
